Greetings!

I am an R & D scientist in the Vancouver, WA area. After spending the past few years working in the textile pretreatment and inkjet ink field I am looking to expand my 

#### Academic History

I graduated in 2008 from the University of Oregon, with a B.S. in three fields - Applied Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. 

#### Academic Lab Experience

In 2010 I joined the Wojtowicz Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Our research was focused on using a modified ELISA technique to study the role of extracellular and secreted proteins in neuronal guidance in the mouse retina. This technique, which combined dimerizing tags (Fc and alkaline phosphatase) with tag-specific antibodies to produce protein tetramers. These tetramers increased the binding strength of otherwise weakly-interacting protein pairs and allowed us to identify novel protein pair interactions that were shown to have neurite guidance effect. The bulk of my contribution was in cloning over 100 different protein isoforms and producing these proteins of interest in HEK293 cells.

In 2012 I assisted with the early setup of the Simon Lab at Yale University.

#### Commercial Lab Experience

In 2013 I started working at Eastern Tech Company, in Milford, CT. My early work was around developing UV-LED cured inkjet inks for rigid and flexible substrates. My main contributions were in the area of inkjet inks and pretreatments for textiles. I developed a patented chemistry that significantly reduced the "staining" of lightly colored fabrics that was typical of direct-to-garment pretreatments.  

#### Database Experience

In 2008 I joined Adidas America as a Master Data Analyst. In that role I was responsible for maintaining the integrity of the newly implemented SAP-ERP system that connected the global master data databases with the Point-of-sale terminals at Adidas stores across the US.
