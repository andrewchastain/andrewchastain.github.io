Welcome to my page! I created this site as an online portfolio of the data analytics projects that I've worked on, along with my reflections on research and development. 

#### Academic History

I graduated in 2008 from the University of Oregon, with a B.S. in three fields - Applied Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. In August, 2019, I completed the 10-course Data Science Specialization with Johns Hopkins University and Coursera, where I learned how to perform data analysis using the programming language R.

#### Academic Lab Experience

In 2010 I joined the Wojtowicz Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Our research was focused on using a modified ELISA technique to study the role of extracellular and secreted proteins in neuronal guidance in the mouse retina. This technique, which combined dimerizing tags (Fc and alkaline phosphatase) with tag-specific antibodies, produce protein tetramers that demonstrated increased binding strengths for otherwise weakly-interacting protein pairs and allowed us to identify novel protein pair interactions that were shown to have neurite guidance effects _in vitro_. In order to demonstrate that the identified proteins could attract or repel neurite growth we used PDMS masks to "stamp" alternating stripes of proteins and culture neurons on those substrates. One component of my work in the Wojtowicz lab was culturing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, a cell line that is able to be chemically differentiated into neuron-like cells that we could use to test our protein patterning process. Another major part of my work was cloning over 100 different protein isoforms from mouse brain/retina cDNA and producing these proteins of interest in HEK293 cells.

In 2012 I assisted with the early setup of the Simon Lab at Yale University. The Simon lab studied the role of long non-coding RNAs in D. melanogaster sex chromosome regulation.

#### Commercial Lab Experience

In 2013 I started working as a research and development scientist at Eastern Tech Company, in Milford, CT. My early work was around developing UV-LED cured inkjet inks for rigid and flexible substrates. In addition to developing these ink sets I also produced adhesion promoters for glass and metal and a special white ink that could be used as an etching mask for glass and circuit boards. My main contributions were in the area of inkjet inks and pretreatments for textiles, producing the company's first patent.

While screen printing is the main way that printed t-shirts are decorated, it requires screens to be created for each color used. The time and cost associated with creating the screens means that screen printing is much more expensive for small production runs, being most cost effective at high volume. Direct-to-garment (DTG) printing provides an alternative by using an ink jet printer to print directly to the surface of the shirt. This technology allows for shirts to be printed from a digital image without producing screens, and offers the ability to produce photorealistic prints.

Printing to white shirts is a straight-forward process, as the CMYK inks that were developed for DTG printers were able to be printed with minimal processing (although some processing techniques will produce a higher quality print). Printing to a colored shirt required a white "underbase" layer as most brightly-colored pigments are highly transparent. In order to produce a bright white, ink-receptive layer a shirt pretreatment is required. The common chemistry being used in most pretreatments had the side-effect of "burning" the underlying cotton, causing a brown discoloration that was visible on all but the darkest shirt colors. I was able to develop an alternative pretreatment chemistry that prevented the burning, allowing printers to use a greater range of colors. 

#### Database Experience

In 2008 I joined Adidas America as a Master Data Analyst. In that role I was responsible for maintaining the integrity of the newly implemented SAP-ERP system that connected the global master data databases with the Point-of-sale terminals at Adidas stores across the US.
